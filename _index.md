# Azure Arc WS Management License Activation Script

This PowerShell script automates the process of checking and enabling Windows Server licenses for Azure Arc-enabled machines.

Upon attestation, customers receive access to the following at no additional cost beyond networking, storage, and log ingestion:

  - Azure Update Manager
  - Azure Change Tracking and Inventory
  - Azure Machine Configuration
  - Windows Admin Center in Azure for Arc
  - Remote Support
  - Network HUD
  - Best Practices Assessment
  - Azure Site Recovery Configuration

Azure Change Tracking and Inventory and Best Practices Assessment require a Log Analytics workspace that may incur data ingestion costs. While the configuration of Azure Site Recovery is included as a benefit, customers incur costs for the Azure Site Recovery service itself, including for any storage, compute, and networking associated with the service.

## üöÄ Features

- Retrieves a list of Azure Arc machines in a given **subscription and resource group**.
- Checks the **Windows Server license activation status**.
- Exports the results to a CSV file (`AzureArc_LicenseStatus.csv`).
- Enables the **Software Assurance license** for machines where it is not already activated.
- Updates the CSV with the operation results.

## üìå Prerequisites

1. Install **Azure PowerShell**:
   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Force
   ```
2. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to manage Azure Arc machines.
3. Authenticate to Azure before running the script.
